#### What is AI and and ML?
Machine learning (ML) is not artificial intelligence (AI) itself, but rather a form of it in which computers fed extremely large data sets are able to learn as changes in that data occur **without being explicitly programmed to do so**. That is, the difference between an algorithm and a *learning* algorithm is that the latter tells the computer what/how to *learn* instead of what/how to do (as the former does). We can exemplify this as follows. Assume we would like to manufacture a really *smart* cooler. What a normal cooler would have buttons to increase/decrease target temperature, set the blowing speed, change the directions of flap motions, etc, whereas a *smart* cooler would set the temperature and blowing speed based on the what it has learned (or has been taught).

What can be more challenging is making machine learning and data science a core capability among companies so that they instinctively take internal and external data sets and interpret it for patterns, risks, opportunities, and so on.
