### Who we are

**QUANTURK** aims to make use of the state-of-the-art quantitative decision tools such as, but not limited to, operations research, data analytics and machine learning to produce solutions for industrial problems. These problems arise in a number industries and can range from developing financial trading algorithms, predicting financial markets for finding optimal investment strategies that match the desired risk/return profile of investors, to estimating the risk of retinal hemorrhage in a patient suffering from diabetic retinopathy.

##### "*We are drowning in data, but starved for knowledge*".

Turning data to insights is probably the most persisting challenge of the present age -- be it for individuals, businesses, or governments. Emergence of digital technologies made it unprecedentedly easy to collect data whereas the increase in computational power had a dramatic impact on our ability in handling massive data sets. What we are probably short of is the skills set to build state-of-the art models that can turn data to simple yet powerful insights.

#### Quantitative Finance for Professionals (QFP)

QFP as part of QUANTURK is a capacity building initiative and continuously updated training programme that is tailored to the everyday needs of finance professionals. It comprises several quantitative skills courses which are taught by qualified financial mathematicians in a simple language. QFP pursues a balance between theory and practice, and it aims to bridge the gap between finance practitioners and state-of-the-art quantitative finance tools. The Programme is envisioned to be a one-stop-shop for finance practitioners where they can acquire the most essential technical skills -- be it risk management, portfolio optimization, asset pricing or building predictive models.
